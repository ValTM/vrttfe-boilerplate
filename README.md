## Vite, React, Typescript, Tailwind, Flowbite, Eslint, Prettier boilerplate

This boilerplate repo is a ready to use React project using Vite for a builder, TypeScript for the logic, JavaScript for the presentation, Tailwind + Tailwind styled components, Flowbite for extra shiny, and Eslint + Prettier for linting and clean code.

It has some example content (it's ugly, I'm sorry) to illustrate it working.

Further improvements can be a state manager - `zustand` with some plugins and `immer`, `@tanstack/react-query` + `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`, `axios` and whatever else you need.

Scripts:

- `dev` to launch the dev server
- `build` to initiate a production build
- `preview` to start a preview server for your production build
- `lint` to lint and autofix all files

Feel free to use as you want.
